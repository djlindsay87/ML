Machine Learning Basics and Fun lil Toy Regressors

RNG is an integer maximum to be represented in binary. The model will predict what integer the binary seqyuence represents.

A learning rate of 0.1 seems to be ideal for most cases and 1000 iterations is typically appropriate for a binary representation of 11-13 digits.
